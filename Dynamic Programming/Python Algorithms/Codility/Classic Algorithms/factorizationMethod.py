# Factorization Method

# Factorization is the process of decomposition into prime factors. 
# More precisely, for a given number x we want to find primes 
# p1, p2, . . . , pk whose product equals x. Use of the sieve enables 
# fast factorization. Let’s modify the sieve algorithm slightly. For
# every crossed number we will remember the smallest prime that 
# divides this number.

#Preparing the array F for factorization
def arrayF(n):  
    F = [0] * (n + 1)
    i = 2
    k = 0
    while (i * i <= n):
        if (F[i] == 0):
            k = i * i
            while (k <= n):
                if (F[k] == 0):
                    F[k] = i
                k += i
        i += 1
    return F


#Factorization of x — O(log x)
def factorization(x):
    n = x + 1
    F = arrayF(n)
    print(F)
    primeFactors = []
    while (F[x] > 0):
        primeFactors += [F[x]]
        x //= F[x]
    primeFactors += [x]
    return primeFactors

print(factorization(15))
