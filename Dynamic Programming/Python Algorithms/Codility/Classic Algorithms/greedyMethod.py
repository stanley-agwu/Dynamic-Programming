#Greedy Algorithms

# For a given set of denominations, you are asked to find the minimum 
# number of coins with which a given amount of money can be paid. That 
# problem can be approached by a greedy algorithm that always selects 
# the largest denomination not exceeding the remaining amount of money 
# to be paid. As long as the remaining amount is greater than zero, 
# the process is repeated.

#Greedy Algorithm for Canoeist Problem
# Problem: There are n > 0 canoeists weighing respectively 1 <= w0 <= w1 
# <=. . . <= wnâˆ’1 <= 10^9. The goal is to seat them in the minimum number 
# of double canoes whose displacement (the maximum load) equals k. You 
# may assume that wi <= k.
# Solution A O(n): The task can be solved by using a greedy algorithm. 
# The heaviest canoeist is called fatso. Other canoeists who can be 
# seated with fatso in the canoe are called skinny. All the other remaining
#  canoeists are also called fatsos.

#Canoeist in O(n) solution.
